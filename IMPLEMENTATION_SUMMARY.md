## 🔌 Backend API Updates Required

### **New Status Endpoints:**
```javascript
// Update job status with validation
PUT /api/jobs/:id/status
Body: {
  status: 'En Route to Customer', // Must be valid next status
  notes: '...',
  metadata: {...}
}

// Validate status transitions on backend
// Can't go from "Assigned" directly to "Collected"
// Must go through "En Route to Customer"
```

### **Batch Shipping Endpoint:**
```javascript
// Ship a batch
PUT /api/batches/:id/ship
Body: {
  actualDepartureTime: '2025-01-25T10:30:00Z',
  notes: 'Loaded on MS Sea Express'
}

Response should:
1. Update batch status to "Shipped"
2. Update all jobs in batch to "Shipped"
3. Record departure timestamp
```

### **Status Validation:**
Backend should validate status transitions using:
```javascript
const VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
  'Pending Collection': ['Assigned'],
  'Assigned': ['En Route to Customer'],
  'En Route to Customer': ['Collected'],
  'Collected': ['Returning to Warehouse'],
  'Returning to Warehouse': ['At Warehouse'],
  'At Warehouse': ['Batched'],
  'Batched': ['Shipped'],
  'Shipped': ['In Transit'],
  'In Transit': ['Arrived at Destination'],
  'Arrived at Destination': ['Out for Delivery'],
  'Out for Delivery': ['Delivered'],
  'Delivered': []
};
```
