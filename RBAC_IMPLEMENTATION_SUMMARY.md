# ✅ RBAC Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

### **Backend (Complete)**

#### 1. Authorization Middleware
- ✅ `authorize(...roles)` - Route-level role checking
- ✅ `checkOwnership(field)` - Resource ownership validation  
- ✅ `requirePermission(...permissions)` - Permission-based access
- ✅ `hasPermission(user, permission)` - Helper function

**Location**: `backend/src/middleware/authorize.js` & `backend/src/middleware/auth.js`

#### 2. Controller-Level Filtering

**Jobs Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/jobController.js`):
- ✅ `getAllJobs()` - Automatically filters jobs by role:
  - **Driver**: Only sees jobs assigned to them
  - **Delivery Agent**: Only sees jobs assigned to them
  - **Warehouse**: Sees all jobs (warehouse location filter TBD)
  - **Admin/Customer-Service/Finance**: See all jobs

- ✅ `getJobById()` - Ownership check:
  - Drivers can only view their assigned jobs
  - Delivery agents can only view their assigned jobs

- ✅ `updateJobStatus()` - Ownership check:
  - Drivers can only update jobs assigned to them
  - Delivery agents can only update jobs assigned to them

#### 3. Route-Level Authorization

**Job Routes** (`backend/src/routes/jobRoutes.js`):
```javascript
GET    /api/jobs              - All authenticated (filtered in controller)
GET    /api/jobs/:id          - All authenticated (ownership checked)
POST   /api/jobs              - authorize('admin', 'customer-service')
PUT    /api/jobs/:id          - authorize('admin')
DELETE /api/jobs/:id          - authorize('admin')
PATCH  /api/jobs/:id/status   - authorize('admin', 'driver', 'delivery-agent', 'warehouse')
POST   /api/jobs/:id/assign   - authorize('admin', 'warehouse')
```

**Customer Routes** (`backend/src/routes/customerRoutes.js`):
```javascript
GET    /api/customers         - All authenticated
GET    /api/customers/:id     - All authenticated
POST   /api/customers         - authorize('admin', 'customer-service')
PUT    /api/customers/:id     - authorize('admin', 'customer-service')
DELETE /api/customers/:id     - authorize('admin')
```

**Auth Routes** (`backend/src/routes/authRoutes.js`):
```javascript
POST   /api/auth/send-invite  - authorize('admin')
GET    /api/auth/invitations  - authorize('admin')
GET    /api/auth/users        - authorize('admin')
```

### **Frontend (Complete)**

#### 1. Permissions Utility
- ✅ `hasPermission(user, permission)` - Check user permissions
- ✅ `hasRole(user, ...roles)` - Check if user has specific role
- ✅ `canAccessRoute(user, route)` - Route access validation
- ✅ `getDashboardRoute(user)` - Get role-specific dashboard
- ✅ `getSidebarMenuItems(user)` - Get role-based menu items
- ✅ `canPerformAction(user, action, resource, data)` - Action validation

**Location**: `frontend/src/utils/permissions.js`

#### 2. Sidebar Menu Filtering
- ✅ Menu items dynamically filtered by user role
- ✅ Each role sees only their relevant menu items
- ✅ Uses `useMemo` for performance

**Location**: `frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`

#### 3. Feature Hiding by Role

**Jobs Page** (`frontend/src/pages/JobsPage.jsx`):
- ✅ "New Job" button only visible to: `admin`, `customer-service`
- ✅ Team members dropdown fetches all assignable users
- ✅ Auto-fetches jobs, customers, team members on mount

**Customers Page** (`frontend/src/pages/CustomersPage.jsx`):
- ✅ "New Customer" button only visible to: `admin`, `customer-service`
- ✅ Auto-fetches customers on mount
- ✅ All roles can view customer details (read-only)

## 🧪 Testing RBAC

### **Test Scenarios:**

1. **Login as Driver** (`icreations2@gmail.com`)
   - ✅ Should only see "My Jobs" in sidebar
   - ✅ Should only see jobs assigned to them
   - ✅ Cannot access /customers, /admin routes
   - ✅ Cannot create new jobs

2. **Login as Admin** (`admin@shipease.com`)
   - ✅ Should see all menu items
   - ✅ Should see all jobs
   - ✅ Can create jobs, customers, etc.
   - ✅ Can access Settings

3. **Test API Directly:**
   ```bash
   # Driver trying to create a job (should fail with 403)
   POST /api/jobs
   Authorization: Bearer {driverToken}
   
   # Driver trying to view all users (should fail with 403)
   GET /api/auth/users
   Authorization: Bearer {driverToken}
   ```

## 🔒 Security Features

### **Backend Protection:**
1. ✅ Route-level authorization via `authorize()` middleware
2. ✅ Controller-level data filtering by role
3. ✅ Ownership validation (drivers can only update their own jobs)
4. ✅ Proper HTTP status codes:
   - `401` - Not authenticated
   - `403` - Insufficient permissions
   - `404` - Resource not found/no access

### **Frontend Protection:**
1. ✅ Dynamic sidebar based on role
2. ✅ Hidden buttons/features for unauthorized roles
3. ✅ Role-based UI rendering
4. ✅ Permission utility for easy checks
